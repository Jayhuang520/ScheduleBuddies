# WhatsHAP?
This is a repository for CSCI 3308 team 5 development.

The project is an app that graphically organizes the events users are interested in or attending on facebook. The project pulls the user's Facebook events data and displays them as pins on Google Maps. The user will see the name, location, time, and details of the events they are interested/attending.

This repository runs with Android Studio, therefore Android Studio is required to build and run the WHATSHAP class.
